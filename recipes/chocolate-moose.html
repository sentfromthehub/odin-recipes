        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is reserved for <strong>VERY</strong> rare events because it requires a lot of work but looks amazing!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1</strong> moose</li>
            <li><strong>40 lbs</strong> Hershey chocolate</li>
            <Li><strong>17 containers</strong> Cool Whip</Li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> cherry</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To capture a moose, send your spouse to Alaska, or have one delivered via UPS.</li>
            <li>In meantime, melt the chocolate in very large double boiler</li>
            <li>Keep warm</li>
            <li>Tie up moose with rope</li>

            <li>Place moose artistically on a large tray, then place in the refrigerator for two days to help the chocolate harden.</li>
            <Li>Put some Cool Whip on the chocolate moose's garnish and add a cherry on top.</Li>
            <li>Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
